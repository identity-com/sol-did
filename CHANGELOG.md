## [3.1.1] - 2022-09-22
### Fixed
- Legacy DID Migration did not work for "inferred" CapabilityInvocation on the "default" VerificationMethod
- `migrate()` operation did not close the legacy account after migration when an legacyAuthority was specified


## [3.1.0] - 2022-09-19
### Added
- Restructured npm packages to be a single `yarn` workspace under [sol-did](./sol-did/package.json)
- `DidSolService` allows to chain multiple "general" operations
- Expose `crate::integrations::is_authority` to check if a key is an authority on a DID.

### Changed
- **Breaking**: `getDidAccount()` now returns a clearer data model for a Verification Method and not the raw on-chain version
- **Breaking**: `addVerificationMethod` and `setVerificationMethodFlags` now accept `flags` as an array of `BitwiseVerificationMethodFlag`
- **Breaking**: Updated `DidSolService.build()` Builder interface signature.
- **Breaking**: `addService` operation takes an additional `allowsOverwrite` flag to allow an update of an existing service without removing it first.
- Client operations with `authority` and `payer` default to `this._wallet.publicKey` and not `this._didAuthority`
- Do not download the IDL from the network, but use the library IDL instead.
- `DidSolService.build` is not `async` anymore. Therefore it does not need to be awaited

### Deprecated

### Removed
- `build()` on DidSolService instance. Use static version instead.

### Fixed
- `getDidAccount()` tolerates existing accounts with No data.

### Security
